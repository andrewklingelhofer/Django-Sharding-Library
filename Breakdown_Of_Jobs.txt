Breakdown of work:

READ OVER: https\://github.com/disqus/sharding-example/blob/master/sqlshards/db/shards/routers.py FOR SOURCE CODE ON SIMILAR IMPLEMENTATION

Within db/shards/:

RENE & JAMES
fields.py
    - Where our overwritten fields go, i.e. how we decide to create our primary keys (BigIntegerField)
    - This is the bulk of our work

RENE & JAMES
helpers.py
    - Any helper functions we may need that we don't want to include elsewhere

EVERYONE
manager.py
    - This is where all our QuerySet modifications go.
    - QuerySet helps partitioning by field in the database
        - Does so by providing hints about what fields are being queried

CASEY & ANDREW
models.py
    - Our partitioned ForeignKey goes here
    - So do the sharding options for the databases
    - This is the bulk of our work

mysql.py
    - Where our SQL functions will go

ANDREW
routers.py
    - Where the sharded info is routed to the correct databases
